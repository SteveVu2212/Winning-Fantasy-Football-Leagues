# 1. Introduction

Originating from French and Porter (2014), the project develops a model utilizing auction contest theory and optimization techniques to optimally assemble a winning team in fantasy football. Before a season starts, team owners create their leagues by bidding on players in an English auction format. Given constraints of budgets and game rules, team owners have to plan on assembling and structuring their teams in order to reach the maximum points in a season.

I employs OR-Tools, delopved and maintained by Google, to solve the optimization problem.

# 2. Team Assembly Model

In general, each team has 15 roster players and a lineup of 9 players start generating points at the beginning while the others are on bench. Owners are allotted 200 bidding tokens and operate an English auction to assembly their teams. There is a minimum starting bid of 1 token. Within the constraint of the game, a valid weekly line-up is with at most 1 quarterback, 2 running backs, 3 wide receivers, 1 tight end, 1 kicker and 1 defense. Thus, owners need to create their player selection and bidding models to optimally participate in a fantasy football game.

Below are fundamental equations. See details in French and Porter (2014).

The objective function is to maximize the total weighted projected points V:

$V = \sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{d=1}^{D_{j}} \sum_{i} w_{jd} * p_{i} * r_{i,d}$   $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$(1)

Subject to:

The roster constraint states the number of required starting roster slots for position j:
 
$\sum_{d=1}^{D_{j}} \sum_{i} r_{i,d} \geq R_{j}$ $∀j$ $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$(2)

The bench constraint shows the number of complementary players sitting on bench:

$\sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{d=R_{j+1}}^{D_{j}} \sum_{i} r_{i,d} \leq 6$ $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ (3)

The singularity constraint reflects that each player can be counter only once:

$\sum_{d=1}^{D_{j}} r_{i,d} \leq 1$ $∀i$ $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ (4)

The budget constraint illustrates the maximum amount of tokens spent on players:

$\sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{d=1}^{D_{j}} \sum_{i} c_{i} * r_{i,d} \leq 200$ $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ (5)

where $p_{i}$ denote the expected points generated by player i, $w_{jd}$ denote the weight to discount player j's projected points based on his depth and $r_{i,d}$ is the indicator variable whether the player is on the team or not. $c_{i}$ denotes the projected cost of player i.


# 3. Results

As a result, the final team is expected to earn 1754.25 points in a season in the National Football League (NFL). There are 15 players on team and 9 of them are lineup. Meanwhile, all of budget has been spent efficiently.
